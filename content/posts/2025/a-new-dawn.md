## New Website and New Goals

I think when I finally get around to learning most of the markdown language, I'll be dangerous.

Castle Nerda or the idea of it has always been to explore programming, deploying, and testing new systems and new languages. The idea has been lost for a while.
Life happens.

This site has been created with Hugo and currently I have the site updates happening manually. I'd like to change that and build a pipeline using GitHub. I've done it before.

You know when that happens because I'll certainly be posting about it.
